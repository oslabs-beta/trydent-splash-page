## What is Trydent?
Trydent is a **lightweight** developer tool built from the ground up to **automate** the generation of Cypress test code, **simplifying** and **streamlining** the testing process for applications.  

The primary purpose of Trydent is to help developers and quality assurance engineers easily generate Cypress test code, saving time and effort while ensuring comprehensive test coverage.
With Trydent, developers can create tests quickly, detect issues earlier in the development process, and maintain high-quality code standards.

<Note>
Trydent logs user inputs during development for the purpose of creating end-to-end tests. The application **does not** extract or store any personal data from users. However, as a precaution, developers should *avoid* using sensitive information when genereating test code. This ensure that no sensitive data is inadvertently recorded or stored in the generated tests.
