## Overview
The `manifest.json` file is a critical component in any Chrome extension. It provides essential metadata about the extension to both the Chrome browser and the Chrome Web Store.


Here's an in-depth explanation of the manifest properties in the `manifest.json` file for Trydent:

#### name
This is the official name of the Chrome extension as it will appear to users. It's currently set as "Trydent".

#### version
This indicates the current version of the Chrome extension, following the semantic versioning guidelines. The current version is "1.0.1".

#### devtools page
The devtools_page property declares a page that will be added to the Chrome Developer Tools as a new panel. The property value is a path to an HTML file within the extension's directory. In this case, it is set to "devtool.html".

#### description
This provides a brief description of the extension's functionality. For Trydent, it's defined as "A Chrome extension that helps you create E2E testing through Cypress".

#### manifest version
This property defines the version of the manifest file format that the package requires. As of Chrome 88, Manifest V3 (MV3) is the current version used by Chrome extensions. This extension uses the MV3 format, indicated by a manifest_version of "3".

#### background
This property is used to register a background service worker, which is a script that runs in the background independently of any user interface. For Trydent, it's "background.js". It also defines a DevTools panel that loads "panel.html" and has the title "panel".

#### icons
This property provides paths to one or more icon files. These icons represent your extension in various places such as the extensions management page, the address bar, and the Chrome Web Store. The icons are set to three different sizes: 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels.

#### content scripts
This property lists JavaScript files that should be injected into pages matching the specified URL patterns. These scripts are run in the context of those pages. In the case of Trydent, the "content-script.js" file is injected into all URLs `<all_urls>`.

#### permissions
This property specifies the permissions your extension requires. Permissions determine which APIs the extension can access. The permissions requested by Trydent include "background", "contextMenus", "tabs", "activeTab", "scripting", and "clipboardWrite".

#### host permissions
This property specifies which hosts the extension can communicate with. It's currently set to `<all_urls>`, which means the extension can interact with all hosts.

These are the main properties specified in Trydent's manifest.json file. Each property has a specific purpose and plays a crucial role in the extension's functionality. Always ensure to correctly fill out this file to avoid any potential issues with your Chrome extension.
